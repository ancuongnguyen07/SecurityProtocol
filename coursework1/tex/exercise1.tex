Given a message \emph{m} and the OTP encryption \emph{c}, we \textbf{can} compute
the OTP key \emph{k} by XORing the plaintext \emph{m} and the ciphertext \emph{c}.
The ciphertext is given by:

\begin{align*}
    c = m \oplus k,
\end{align*}

therefore, we can easily compute the \emph{k} by:

\begin{align*}
    k = c \oplus m,
\end{align*}

where \emph{c} and \emph{m} are known.
