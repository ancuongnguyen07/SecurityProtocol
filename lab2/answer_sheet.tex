\section*{Exercise 1}
%
I chose the CBC mode of AES symmetic block cipher because its simplicity - one of
classic modes. But in terms of authentication, we should consider modern modes such as
CCM, EAX, GCM, SIV, and OCB.

    \label{fig:aes-cbc}
\end{figure}

As you can see, the decryption takes a shorter time than the encryption process,
faster than 60 times in this case.

\section*{Exercise 2}

\subsection*{RSA}
%
It worth noting that the process of decryption/signing is much slower than those of
encryption/verification (signing and verification used in digital signatures).
In this exercise, I used PKCS#1 OAEp is an asymmetric cipher based on RSA and the
OAEP padding, detailed description \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017}{here}.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Eliptic Curve}
%
\begin{figure}[hpt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm, height=50mm]{ec.png}
    \caption{EC-based encrytion-decrytion time}
    \label{fig:ec}
\end{figure}

As you can see in the figure~\ref{fig:ec}, the encryption time is much longer than 
the decryption time, constrasting to the RSA scheme

\section*{Exercise 3}
%
To verify the integrity of the specific file, we need to compute the hash digest of the
recieved file, then compare it to the hash digest which was sent along with the file.
If they matches each other, so the file was not modified, otherwise the file was intervened.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=140mm, height=50mm]{sha256.png}
    \caption{SHA256 verification-cumputation}
    \label{fig:sha256}
\end{figure}

As you can see in the figure~\ref{fig:sha256}, when I just changed one letter ``e'' to ``a'', the
generated hash digest was change totally (not partially one letter), showing that hash function
has the property of diffusion.
